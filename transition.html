  If you use the term "all", you can delete 'background' from the following code:
  <br>
  transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear;

  "CSS Transitions allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly
 over a specified duration."
 <br>ease: Transitions with slow start, then fast, then slowly ends.
 <br>linear: Transitions at a linear/steady speed from start to end
 <br>ease-in: Transitions slowly when it starts.
 <br>ease-out: Transitions out slowly.
 <br>ease-in-out: Transitions slowly in and slowly out.
 <br>cubic bezier: You can set 4 values (n,n,n,n) in a cubic-bezier function.
